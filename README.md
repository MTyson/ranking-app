# A simple demo of using KOA to define a RESTful API
Just a proof-of-skillset for Jobot opportunity.  

This is a *quickly built demo*.  You can run it by cloning this repo, then:
/frontend/ $ npm start
/backend/ $ npm dev

## Uses MongoDB for persistence (running on localhost)

## Uses basic React frontend for client (VERY basic at the moment)

## Backend uses KOA, mongo driver, bodyparser, etc.

## Uses typescript (loosely at the moment)

### If you are looking at this, and would like to see something added or refined 

* better error handling?  
* More organized API sections?
* Security?  Want to see some authentication/authorization?
* Consume an external API?
* Beautify the front-end a bit?
* Componetize the React UI?
* better tests?
* improved typescript typing?
* Something else?
