This started with the following question:

:: What is the greatest song ever written? ::

Then it started growing:

* What's the better album: Dark Side of the Moon, or Joshua Tree?
* Whose the better songwriter: John Lennon, or Bob Marley?
* Bach vs. Beethoven?

And then it got into other areas, like a virus:

* Socrates vs. Lao Tzu (philosophers)?
* George Washington vs. Gandhi (liberators)
* Alexander the Great vs. Ghenghis Khan (conquerors)?

## Run it full-stack:

1: Make sure mongo is running in background on localhost
2: /backend/ $ npm dev
3: /frontend/ $ npm start

## Uses MongoDB for persistence (running on localhost)
TODO: support different environments
TODO: Authentication
TODO: Demo

## Uses basic React frontend for client 

## Backend uses KOA, mongo driver, bodyparser, etc.

## ~~uses typescript~~ Typescript is slower-to-code than JS, so this is going back to straight JS
